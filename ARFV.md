# Analog/RF Verfication Flow Development

## Purpose
        1. build a univeral analog/RF verification library in python


## Research Plan
        1. python basics
        1. cadence simulation basics
                - under-stand simulation types and testbench setup
                - learn how to run simulation and view simulaiton results in cadence
        1. behavior study of common analog/RF
                - review specifications and function of analog/RF building blocks
                -  setup universal testbench for a list of analog/RF building blocks

        1. stimuls generation and results processing, propose grade algorithm for specific circuits and simulaitons
        1. release full re-usable library in python
